<root>[Letter from <person name="true" author="true">Marian Baldwin</person>, <date
        when="1917-06-30">June 30, 1917</date>] <location>On Board La Touraine</location>,
        <date>June 30th, 1917</date>. <paragraph num="1">Even now that we are out of sight of land,
        it seems impossible that I am actually off to <location>France</location> and, for the first
        time in my life, traveling alone. Everything has happened so quickly since the American Fund
        for French Wounded found an opening for me in <location>Paris</location> that I suppose I am
        still somewhat dazed and bewildered. The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and
        that I can't look ahead makes it easier to be happy and live in the present. Of course I
        have had a bit of a taste in <location>New York</location> of the work that the A. F. F. W.
        is doing but its Headquarters in <location>Paris</location> will be different in some ways I
        fancy.</paragraph>
    <paragraph num="2">I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few
            <person people="more than 1">girls</person> of my age are getting across, and I
        understood the grit and pluck which made you encourage me on my great adventure and send me
        along a path which has proved so dangerous of late.</paragraph>
    <paragraph num="3">As we drifted down the river, in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing
        alongside, I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our minds.
        How many of this ship's company will see that sky-line again! It was very quiet, no one
        spoke much, and, little by little, the glow faded from the sky and one star after another
        appeared. I knew that you would be looking at those same stars down in
            <location>Lakewood</location> and that your thoughts and prayers were the same that
        filled my heart at that moment. Somehow distance does not separate, after all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph num="4">We waited near the <landmark>Statue of Liberty</landmark> until midnight—a
        rumor had it that a "personage" was to come on board. This individual was shrouded in
        mystery until we put to sea when it was given out that the party which had clambered aboard
        in the night was none other than the Italian Mission. Our spirits rose at once for, what
        with <person name="true">Frank Sayre</person> on the boat and these <person
            people="more than 1">distinguished Italian gentlemen</person>, we shall doubtless be
        honored by a bigger convoy and so doubly safe. However, thus far we have but two destroyers
        following us. They can be seen distinctly outlined against the horizon, one on each side,
        and seem to be the same somber gray which all ships are affecting in this war. <person>A
            sailor</person> informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the first
        four or five days but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's
        hoping!</paragraph>
    <paragraph num="5">I have <location>a small inside cabin</location> and <person>my
            room-mate</person> is quite a character. She is a native of <location>Haiti</location>,
        voluble and very portly—has four large pieces of baggage in our tiny stateroom, wears a
        costume which resembles a Mother Hubbard and smokes countless thin cigarettes that smell
        like incense! When I appeared, there didn't seem to be much room for me but, as she says,
        luckily I am small, and I was soon tucked into the upper berth with my belongings! She
        really isn't bad and after looking me over carefully told me that she didn't think we would
        fight and from that time has beamed upon me! She is going over to join <person>her
            son</person> who has been fighting with the French since the beginning of the war but
        will never go back to the Front now, having lost some fingers off each hand. She is so
        thankful, she says, that he hasn't lost more than his fingers.</paragraph>
